This is the watermelon game where there are a series of fruits (Blueberry, Strawberry, Orange, and Melon). The user who is playing is trying to get as many watermelons as possible by combining 2 of the same fruits together. 2 blueberries will make 1 strawberry, 2 strawberries will make 1 orange, and 2 oranges will make a melon. 

Start the game by following the instructions and press space. 

When the user gets a melon, the score goes up and the user is trying to get as many melons as possible to get the highest score.

The user can lose the game by piling up the fruits too high and the fruits reach out of the screen. This is triggered if an Orange, Strawberry, or Blueberry touches y = -5. End Screen will appear with score and instructions to restart. 

Restart the game by pressing space. Try not to let the mouse leave the screen otherwise it may cause some issues to the game. 


**Motivation
Score: Trying to get the highest score possible 
Very addicting to play to try to combine the fruits together as well as since the blueberries and strawberries randomize when dropped. 



**Features
Makes a sound every time the user gets a watermelon. 

Score: Score goes up every time the user gets a watermelon




**Array
This is used on the Title screen for the watermelon that is dancing. This is in the Watermelon subclass under Actor.
